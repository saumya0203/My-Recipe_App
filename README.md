## 🧠 How It Works

* On the homepage (`/`), the app shows a list of meals using the `<Food />` component.
* When a user clicks on a meal, it navigates to `/:mealid` using React Router.
* The `<Recipe />` component fetches and displays recipe details using [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).
